### Project Overview
**** Smart Intrusion Detection System
- topic: Distributed Cluster Inference, 3D Visualization, Trajectory Tracking, Intrusion Alerts, and Face Recognition
- Introduction: This project develops an advanced smart park security solution that integrates multiple technologies. It leverages distributed cluster inference for efficient parallel processing, handling large-scale data and complex scenarios. A 3D visualization platform provides real-time monitoring with intuitive views of personnel and vehicle activities. The system tracks trajectories in real-time and records violation videos for post-event review. Virtual fences trigger intrusion alerts for unauthorized entries, ensuring timely responses. Face recognition identifies registered individuals and alerts on unregistered ones. Suitable for smart parks, corporate campuses, and public spaces, this system enhances security management efficiency and safety.

Project Goals: 
Event accuracy rate higher than 95%
Less than 0.5 false alarms per hour
Event detection within 1 minute
Event traceability for up to 6 months
